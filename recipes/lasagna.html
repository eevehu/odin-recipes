    <h3><p>The secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.</p></h3>
    
    <h4 class="preamble"><p>There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, such as adding a dash of wine vinegar</p> 
        <p>to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.</p></h4>

                <dd><p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.</p>
                    <p>Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.</p>
                    <p>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition.</p>
                    <p>(The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic your tomatoes are.)</p>
                    <p>Add salt to taste. Remember that you will later be adding parmesan, which is salty.</p>
                    <p>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer.</p>
                    <p> Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot occasionally, making sure nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.</p>
                    <p>Remove from heat.</p>

                <dt><h3>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</h3></dt>
                <dd><p>By now, the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note: noodles may be cooked in advance.)

                        Stir the water often to prevent sticking. Make sure that the water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking process, in order to prevent noodles from sticking.

                        When the noodles are done, drain them in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.

                        Spread a little olive oil on a large, rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them once so that all sides get coated with some of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together.</p></dd>

                <dt><h3>Assemble the lasagna:</h3></dt>
                <dd><p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce over the bottom of the dish and spread it evenly. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise over the sauce (about 3 long noodles; the edges may overlap, depending on your pan). Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.

                        Sprinkle a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce. Add half of the ricotta cheese by placing cheese dollops every two inches. Sprinkle half of the grated parmesan cheese evenly over the top of the ricotta cheese.

                        Apply the second layer of noodles. Top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining mozzarella, the rest of the ricotta cheese, and the rest of the parmesan cheese.

                        Finish with a final layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</p></dd>
