    <h3><p>Step by step instructions on making a beautiful pizza!</p></h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella</li>
        <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>handful of basil leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it is not essential for a thin crust.</p></li>
        <li><p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p></li>
        <li><p>Roll out the dough: if you have let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p></li>
        <li><p>and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p></li>
