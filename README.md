The purpose of this project is to showcase the vast resivour of techniques and syntax I have learnt thus far.
An unordered list of these elements would go something like this:

*<a href target rel></a>
*<p></p>
*<meta charset>
*<h1-6></h1-6>
*<strong></strong>
*<em></em>
*<img href alt />

Those aren't all of them, since if I was to list all the ones I know, I'd be here all day!
